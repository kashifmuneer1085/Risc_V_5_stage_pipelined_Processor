# Risc_V_5_stage_pipelined_Processor
This repository implements a RISC-V processor, starting with a Single-Cycle Processor with CSR and extending into a 5-Stage Pipelined Processor. It features CSR integration, hazard handling, and efficient pipelining, showcasing my understanding of RISC-V architecture, processor design, and optimization techniques.
